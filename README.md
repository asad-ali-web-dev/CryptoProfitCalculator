# Welcome to CPC

Hi! I'm **Asad Ali**, I have created **CPC** (*stands for* Crypto Profit Calculator) for quickly estimating the *PROFIT* and being aware of the future *LOSS* to prevent it from happening by taking necessary steps in accordance to the information calculated by the **CPC**.

Currently this console application written in C++ is only in the personal use of my brother Danish Fareed. But, anyone can fork or clone this repository to personalize and customize this piece of application according to one's needs.


# Files

The file structure of this CPC console application is very simple all the files can operate **offline!**
There are two main files and one README.md file for the purpose of this markdown you are reading.

 - File with the extension **.exe** is the executable file that don't need any technical knowledge about programing and can be used by anyone without any problem. 
 
**NOTE:** *
